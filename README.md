Firebase push notification send to topic (VB.NET)

This code is modified from the code taken from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55589936/using-vb-net-to-sent-notification-to-android-emulator-get-error-401 instead of sending push notification to device ids, it sends message to subscribed topic to Android and iOS as silent push notification.
